# QuakeMap: Single Page App

- This simple web app uses the USGS API with the Mapbox API to visualize and interact with USGS earthquake data tracked over the past 24 hours
- Each dot represents a quake; the darker the dot the higher in magnitude the quake
- Click on each dot to get more information about the quake including magnitude, time, and location
- Use the Mapbox Geocoder control to search, mark, and zoom into a specified location
- Navigate the map using Mapbox zoom controls

-This project uses Webpack to package frontend JS modules and the Node framework Express to set up a basic server.
